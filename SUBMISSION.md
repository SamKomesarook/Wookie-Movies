Thanks for taking a look at my submission!

First things first: I did not have time to add the search function.

Or a special item, for that matter!

I wanted to make the main screen look as best as possible before moving on, ensuring everything was tested correctly.

That being said, there are a number of style fixes I would have implemented. Icons, a prettier font, better sizing, and a more natural looking scroll function.

If I had more time, I would have preferred to add more snapshot tests, maybe some functional ones for the API requests, and refractor components to be cleaner.

Of course, I would have added the react tab navigator and the search function.

Thanks again for your consideration!
